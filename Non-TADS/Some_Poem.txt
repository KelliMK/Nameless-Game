You can feel her very faintly
You're not adept with your pen but when you type your muscle memory takes hold, 
and you feel the slightest throb in your head

She's here.
She starts to move your fingers for you. 
Only the hands become hers,
but what she does with them.

It starts when you accidentally type "this" when reading the word "their"
You key in "instant" instead of "instance"
"is" instead of "as"
"mine" instead of "mirth"

The twinge starts in your forehead,
and you look at your hands.
You can't feel them move, 
but there they are.

They move you.
